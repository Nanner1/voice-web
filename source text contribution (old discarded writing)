Three teens waited in silence on a warm Saturday morning.
All the while they sat, the lone boy looked increasingly uncomfortable.
His fingers twitched.
The blond boy took a shaky breath.
You've got to be kidding me.
I mean, he's good with words and I'm not.
Please let him speak.
He's crossed a line.
He talks, then he leaves.
Thanks, Maria.
It had been easier than I'd expected.
He didn't seem to be enjoying the party all that much.
Mike raised an eyebrow.
I shifted uncomfortably.
I won't help.
That seemed a bit harsh.
He left me waiting for an awkwardly long period of time.
I pitched my plan to him.
It was a great party.
He waited at my shoulder, constantly shifting with excitement.
Here we go.
It suddenly felt real.
Eventually, I followed.
My jaw dropped.
Go for it!
Why not?
I fumbled with my keys until the door creaked open.
I raked my fingers through my hair.
Get on with it.
How are you this lovely evening?
I could practically hear Ken rolling his eyes.
I'll be back in six hours.
People say that the eyes are windows to the soul.
I was in far too deep with this.
The expression looked foreign on him.
A strange sound echoed through the room.
He looked like he wanted to disappear.
I made a mental note to myself.
I took a bite of the apple.
A thought occurred to me.
It will never be worth this.
Are you cold?
I scuttled away as quickly as I could.
He wasted no time sharing the news.
Better you than me.
I rolled my eyes at his theatrics.
This isn't your fault.
It had seemed funny at the time.
Get down from there!
I wiggled my fingers, relieved to see that I still could.
Understatement of the year, isn't it?
Thanks for that contribution.
My friend had made several good points.
Can I see your hand?
It was clearly a dismissal.
My fantastic day was in ruins.
Might as well put the time to good use.
You've seen my writing?
That would be cool.
My hands were shaking with an emotion I couldn't identify.
I'd never been more proud of something I'd created.
Bonus points if you show up in costume.
The glint in his eye confirmed my fears.
Don't call him that.
A sense of relief washed over me.
Come on, your entire wardrobe is black.
He sounded young.
Lots of things are your fault, but this isn't one of them.
That went surprisingly well.
Selfishly, I hoped he never reached that conclusion.
That would have been bad.
The sinister smile on his face wasn't very encouraging.
They weren't supposed to be here.
At least I had a plan.
He snorted derisively.
It's just a movie.
We need to move forward.
It felt like a vow.
Please don't do that.
I'm absolutely going to do that.
Mike had never been particularly subtle.
I was too tired for manners.
My mouth fell open in total shock.
The rumour mill would have a field day.
We both turned to her in disbelief.
I only met him five minutes ago.
You didn't tell me that.
It was a subtle comfort.
He looked annoyingly smug.
Careful, there are children about.
Well, I wish you luck.
Stop thinking about that.
